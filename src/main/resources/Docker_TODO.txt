- Start from resin/rpi-raspbian:wheezy (this is what all of hypriot's pre-built images also use)
- Add JDK 8
- Unzip jar file and RUN the sh file
- Need to make audio work by passing the device to docker container from host

OLD TODO:
   Notes from WLS 1213 dockerfile:
   # (2) jdk-8u60-linux-x64.rpm Download from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
   Alternatively, do apt-get for openjdk8 similar to the hypriot_openjdk7 dockerfile in SampleDockerfiles directory (from hypriot/rpi-java)
- Add glassfish 4.1
   See the glassfish4.1 dockerfile
- Deploy our war file as part of adding glassfish 4.1
- Add elasticsearch
   See elasticsearch_1.7.txt in the SampleDockerfiles dir (from elasticsearch/1.7)
   Can we just download their dockerfile and run it locally? (Answer: No, because it uses FROM java:8-jre - which means the jre image incompatible with our raspberry pi architecture will be downloaded)
- Commands should include starting ES and Glassfish
